# source-copyallmodels
Windows - Copies all of model paths when ran inside a folder, perfect for Garry's Mod.
Requires to be launched with the path of the directory you want to get the paths from, and it must have a "models" folder right after.

I suggest it to be launched with a bat file or a link with regedit to the Context Menu with "CopyAllModels.exe /V" as an argument for the full current path, like I did: https://i.imgur.com/3JBNRfc.png.

**REQUIRES THAT YOU ADD A REFERENCE TO `System.Windows.Forms` MANUALLY**

Feel free to modify and re-distribute the code, but you must credit me if you do so : )
